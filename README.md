### Macarena Acha 👋


I'm Maca from Argentina, and I'm Full Stack at MERN (MongDB, Express, React, Node). Thanks to my time in Mindhub, of more than 600 hours, in full time mode, simulating a real environment, I developed different group and individual projects. I have previous studies in Industrial Design and UX/UI Design, which allow me to have an overview of different concepts, and a great insertion in group work.
