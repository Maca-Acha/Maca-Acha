### Macarena Acha ðŸ‘‹


I'm Maca from Argentina, and I'm Full Stack at MERN (MongDB, Express, React, Node). Thanks to my time in Mindhub, of more than 600 hours, in full time mode, simulating a real environment, I developed different group and individual projects. I have previous studies in Industrial Design and UX/UI Design, which allow me to have an overview of different concepts, and a great insertion in group work.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Web and Mobile development technologies
- ðŸ˜„ Iâ€™m interesting in Web and Mobile projects
- âš¡ 2022 Goals: Become a Full Stack Development Worker
